# Collaboration and Delegation

## Collaboration with Raleigh

We talked to kdemaria about collaborating on the flyers.  She told us about
the flyers they were designing with the branding standards.

The Westford Promo group voted to stick with the Raleigh slogan "One Summer,
Lasting Impact" for the flyer campaign, for simplicity's sake (not having
to remake the header).  It will also present a more unified image between the offices.

We may use our "pun" slogans as email headers or content, for fun.

**Schedule Change**
Although our inital schedule implied starting a "lead-in" campaign this week,
we agree with Raleigh that campaigning too far in advance might lead to people
getting irritated at the emails.  In addition, the flyers won't be ready for at least a week.

## Specific Item Schedules

### Flyers
Subject to Raleigh scheduling

### Digital Signage on Screens
We decided to run these at the same time we post the paper flyers, so this is also
dependent on Raleigh scheduling.  However, we will post them the week before the 
expo at the latest (Monday 7/28).

** Question for Jamie **
At the group leads meeting, we showed Jamie the slide draft (see digital_signage_1).
She approved of content but wanted us to use the intern slideshow template instead.
We'd acquired that template from https://mojo.redhat.com/groups/digital-signage as per
the facilities, so we were unsure as to whether the intern slide template was approved for 
the digital signs, as it's not listed on the mojo page.
If it's okay to use the intern template, we'd appreciate it if Jamie could send that to us
so we can transfer the content to the new slides.

### Emails
Email will still go out ahead of time, just as a heads-up to employees.
mheon put in charge of emails, will send first mail to boston-list by middle of next week 7/21 - 7/25
Will send a draft of the email to the Promo team for review the day before sending.

** Email Images? **
Mark volunteered to design a clever image to attach to emails.  Will finish by end of this week/
beginning of next week.  If it passes Jamie's approval it will be attached to mheon's email.
