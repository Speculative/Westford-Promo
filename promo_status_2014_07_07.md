# Signage Planning: Paper and Digital

## Digital Signage

We got a response and were directed to the Mojo page with instructions and 
templates for the digital screens.  We worked together to decide what information
we wanted to convey on the digital screens, and created a draft which we
would like to have reviewed before submitting.

Please see the file digital_signage_1 in the repo.

We plan to have this sign posted the week before the expo.  We'll switch it
to a new sign the week of the expo with a more urgent message.

## Paper Signage

After discussing with facilities, we found that locations for paper flyers are
more limited than we originally thought.  Therefore, we have decided to have paper
flyers have a less prominent focus in our campaign than originally intended.

This change to the plan has the following impacts:
 - More focus on email messages for promotion
	* Emails are plaintext and don't need to follow the branding standard
	* Employees are more likely to read emails than happen to notice
	and spend the time to read a paper sign
	* Clever emails with attention-grabbing subjects will be noticed
	* Emails are archived and can be checked again in case they forget
 - More collaboration with Raleigh for paper flyers
	* We don't feel as qualified to design corporate branded flyers
	* We want to present a unified image across the offices

Therefore, we have the following requests pertaining to the flyer templates:
 - Editable template (not in pdf format) so that we can 
 	* change the date and time to reflect the Westford Expo
 	* add/modify header to advertise the ice cream social portion of the Westford event
 - Easy access format of the intern expo brand styles
 	* in designing our brochure, we need to be able to use the elements
 	listed in the style guide
 	* the style guide that was emailed out has no way for us to take those
 	style elements and apply them to our brochure document

## Other Notes

 - Focus group testing with former interns suggested that we advertise free ice cream prominently
 - Action needed on raffle:
 	* Raffle prize follow-up - can John knit something?  If not, what can we give as a prize?
 	* Need to ask about leftover raffle tickets from summer kick-off
 - Deadline for brochure bios is this Friday 7/11

## In Progress

Next week marks beginning of lead-in campaign according to schedule

**ACTION ITEMS**
 - Have 1-2 emails drafted by the end of this week to send to boston-list next week
 - Find out from Raleigh when we can get editable versions of flyer style elements
 - Edit flyers to contain relevant Westford information
